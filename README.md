A CS2 plugin that lets you add as many players as the server's `maxplayers` allow, regardless of map limits.


## Description
This plugin allows you to add as many players as you want by reusing existing map spawns, and making collisions between players non-blocking.

- [CounterStrikeSharp](https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp)

## Install
1. Install Metamod:Source and Counter Strike Sharp.
2. Copy `CS2-InfiniteSpawns` to `csgo/addons/counterstrikesharp/plugins/`.
